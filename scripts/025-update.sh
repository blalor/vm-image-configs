## there's a disconnect between pv-grub and regular grub.  pv-grub reads
## /boot/grub/menu.lst, regular grub reads /boot/grub/grub.conf.  the kernel
## package scripts (rpm -q --scripts kernel) implicitly expect /etc/grub.conf to
## be a symlink to /boot/grub/grub.conf.  The target of that symlink gets
## deleted and recreated, which breaks hard links.  I had a problem with a soft
## link for the same reason.  So, basically the kernel package needs to be
## spoon-fed. :-(

    ## these are hard-linked on the VBox instance; gotta break that first
